For Notepad++, double-click on the very bottom of the window with a text file open (it should say "Normal text file"), then select "Define your language"
From there select "Import" and browse to this file on your PC. Save as "Phrancis Notes Markup" (or whatever other name of your choosing). It should then appear in the syntax highlight chooser at the bottom when you open a file.
